                    <li>Syntax: Java has a specific syntax that defines how programs are written. This syntax includes keywords, operators, variables, and expressions.</li>
                    <li>Data types: Java has a set of primitive data types, such as int, double, and boolean, which are used to define variables and constants.</li>
                    <li>Control structures: Java has several control structures, such as if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements, which are used to control the flow of a program.</li>
                    <li>Objects and classes: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that everything in Java is an object. Objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and behaviors of an object.</li>
                    <li>Inheritance: Java supports inheritance, which is a mechanism for creating new classes from existing classes. Inheritance allows developers to create new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes, which can save time and reduce code duplication.</li>
                    <li>Interfaces: Java also supports interfaces, which define a set of methods that a class must implement. Interfaces allow developers to define a common set of behaviors that multiple classes can share.</li>
                    <li>Exception handling: Java has built-in support for exception handling, which allows developers to handle errors and unexpected situations in a program.</li>
                    <li>Libraries: Java includes a large set of libraries, such as the Java Class Library, that provide developers with pre-written code for common tasks, such as file input/output, network communication, and user interface development.</li>
                    <li>Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM acts as a virtual computer that can execute Java bytecode on any hardware platform, which makes Java code highly portable.</li>

                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <p>1. Object-oriented: Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it is based on the concepts of objects and classes. This makes it easy to write and maintain code, as well as reuse existing code.</p>
                    <p>2. Platform-independent: Java is platform-independent, which means that code written in Java can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes Java an ideal language for writing cross-platform applications.</p>
                    <p>3. Simple: Java was designed to be a simple language that is easy to learn and use. It has a syntax that is similar to C and C++, but with fewer complex features.</p>
                    <p>4. Secure: Java was designed with security in mind, and includes features such as automatic memory management, which helps prevent common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and memory leaks.</p>
                    <p>5. High performance: Java is a high-performance language that is optimized for speed and efficiency. The Java Virtual Machine includes a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that can dynamically compile code at runtime, which helps improve performance.</p>
                    <p>6. Multithreaded: Java includes built-in support for multithreading, which allows programs to run multiple threads of execution concurrently. This makes it easy to write programs that can take advantage of modern multicore processors.</p>
                    <p>7. Rich API: Java includes a rich set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that make it easy to develop a wide range of applications, from desktop applications to web applications to mobile apps.</p>
                    <p>8. Open source: Java is an open-source language, which means that its source code is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone.</p>
                    <p>9. Community support: Java has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support and resources for other developers.</p>
