                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the C programming language and is designed to allow developers to write high-level code that can run efficiently on a wide range of hardware platforms.</p>
                        <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects and classes. It allows developers to create complex, modular programs by breaking down their code into smaller, reusable components. This makes it easy to write and maintain code, as well as reuse existing code.</p>
                        <p>C++ is also a compiled language, which means that the code is compiled into machine code that can be executed directly by the computer's hardware. This makes it fast and efficient, and it is commonly used for performance-critical applications such as video games, operating systems, and scientific simulations.</p>
                        <p>One of the key features of C++ is its support for low-level programming. It provides direct access to the computer's hardware through features such as pointers, which allow developers to manipulate memory directly. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as it allows for fine-grained control over the system but can also lead to hard-to-find bugs if not used carefully.</p>
                        <p>C++ also has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support and resources for other developers. It is used by a wide range of industries, including finance, aerospace, and automotive, and is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>C++ was created in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist who was working at Bell Labs at the time. He needed a programming language that could handle the complex, low-level tasks required by the operating system while still providing a high-level, object-oriented interface for developers. C was the most popular programming language for systems programming at the time, but it lacked support for object-oriented programming. Stroustrup decided to create a new programming language that would combine the simplicity and efficiency of C with the object-oriented features of Simula. The result was C++, which was first released in 1983 as a set of extensions to the C programming language.</p>
                        <p>C++
                          quickly gained popularity among developers due to its flexibility, efficiency, and support for object-oriented programming. In 1985, the first commercial implementation of C++ was released by AT&T, and by the early 1990s, C++ had become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.</p>
                          <p>Since its initial release, C++ has undergone several revisions, with the most recent being C++20, which was released in 2020. These revisions have added new features to the language and improved its performance, while also addressing issues with earlier versions.</p>
                          <p>Today, C++ is used in a wide range of applications, from operating systems and video games to finance and scientific simulations. Its popularity has also led to the development of several frameworks and libraries that make it easier for developers to use C++ to create complex applications.</p>
